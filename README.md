Contribution Guide
===
Contributions can be made with a standard github pull request model.  Code developed for the next release should be requested to be pulled into the "develop" branch.
Pull requests not targetted for "develop" will be denied.  For hotfixes please open a ticket describing the problem and ideally a fix and your changes will be attributed in the relevant commit message.  It's done like this because unfortunately github provides no tools to target to a new hotfix branch, and github tools are exclusively used in the administration of this repository and we wish to minimize the amount of unvetted code into master.
