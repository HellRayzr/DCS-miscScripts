Misc DCS Scripts
=====================

This is a repository for miscellaneous scripts and missions created for Digital Combat Simulator

Some scripts will require MIST, while others do not. Each script and related files will be grouped into separate folders. I am using github simply as means for distribution and accessibility.

Training Sams. A simple script that tracks missiles fired by AI at any player aircraft, when the missile gets close enough that it will likely hit the player the missile will be removed and a message displayed that the player would have been hit. This script is useful for training for evasion against enemy missile threats while not having to respawn. 
On Station Classic. Mission and script. 



Contribution Guide
===
Contributions can be made with a standard github pull request model.  Code developed for the next release should be requested to be pulled into the "develop" branch.
Pull requests not targetted for "develop" will be denied.  For hotfixes please open a ticket describing the problem and ideally a fix and your changes will be attributed in the relevant commit message.  It's done like this because unfortunately github provides no tools to target to a new hotfix branch, and github tools are exclusively used in the administration of this repository and we wish to minimize the amount of unvetted code into master.
